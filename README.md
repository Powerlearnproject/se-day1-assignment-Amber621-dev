# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to development and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
- Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems of certain aspects such as healthcare, including communication, commerce, entertainment and communication.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages such as C, Python 
- Agile methodologies - focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
- Software engineering development   

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements - Collecting and documenting user needs and sysytem requirements.
- Design - Creating detailed designs of the software
- Implementation- Creating the code and the building the software according to the design specifications
- Testing -To ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
- Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintaenance - Providing support and update of the software 

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall focuses on sequential approach example is building a house while Agile focuses on incremental approach example is scrum 

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer - To write a code and implement software solutions
- Quality assurance engineer - Executing test plans to ensure quality
- Project manager - Overseeing overral planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example Visual Studio,while VCS is important in tracking changes and sourcing code while coordinating work among team members example is Git

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Tight deadlines
- Changing requirements
- Tight debt
  These challenges can be overcomed through effective communication, Prioritizing tasks and agile methodologies

8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing; this is testing of individual components of software 
- Integration Testing; testing interactions between subsystems
- System Testing; testing the whole software system
- Acceptance Testing; : Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


9. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is creating questions in a way that you get the best response for from AI models. Prompt engineering helps you get the exact thing that you need, clear specific thing you need. 

10. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague prompt- 'Tell me about cars'
-Improved Prompt - 'Tell me about Porche Cayenne 2016 model'
-The improved prompt is very specific and precise.
